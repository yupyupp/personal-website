Title:	New site using Pelican
Date:	9-10-2014

After playing around with a few different website generators I have finally settled on [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). Pelican is a static site generator written in python that takes Markdown, reStructuredText, or just plain HTML and parses it into nicely formated posts and pages. It also allows you to choose from a bunch of different themes or you can build one yourself.

I plan to continue to developing my theme ([pelican-theme-zev](https://github.com/kd8zev/pelican-theme-zev)) so it has an option to display a set page as the home page rather than the most recent posts. But I'll have to dig further into the API of pelican and jinja so thats not a job for tonight :)
