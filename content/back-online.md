Title:	Finally back online!
Date:	01-31-2016

After being down for several months I have finally gotten my site back up and running! I originally took the site down because I wanted to play around with virtualisation on my server. I ended up playing with OpenStack, XEN, KVM, LXC, and Docker but I finally settled on plain KVM and I now have a KVM host up and running on my Cincinnati server (this site is hosted on a VPS instead of my KVM host for the time being).

Now that this is back up its time to tackle setting up my own mail server!
