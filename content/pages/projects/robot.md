The FEH (Fundamentals of Engineering, Honors) Robot Design Project is a project in which teams of four freshman honors engineering students design, program, and build a robot to compete on a course with tasks designed by the faculty and staff of the FEH program. The tasks must be completed autonomously in under two minutes. To see my team's website, enter the password "FEH2014" on [this site](https://u.osu.edu/feh14a4).
