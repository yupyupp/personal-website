[CSE 3902](/static/course_desc/CSE-3902.pdf) was a semester-long game development group project that I took autumn semester of 2015. My assigned group created a clone of Super Mario Bros in C#. The course lectures taught us about various object-oriented design patterns as well as the benefits and pitfalls of Agile software development methodologies. The design patterns we used allowed us to take a full advantage of the object-oriented nature of C# and made it easier to expand our game and reuse code that we had written previously. By the end of the semester we were able to present our working game to the class.
