[Pelican](http://getpelican.com) is the application that I use to generate this site. It is a static website generator written in python that converts content written in markdown into webpages. There are many themes that I could have chosen, but none of them were quite what I wanted so I decided to make my own theme.

Writing a theme uses a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) (A python HTML template engine that allows logic and inheritance in HTML templates). While I have had a *tiny* bit of experience with web development in this past, I would consider these themes my first real experience with it. I started with one of the supplied themes, tore it apart, deleted the parts I disliked, and added in more and more features that I wanted in this site.

My first theme, [pelican-theme-zev](https://github.com/kd8zev/pelican-theme-zev), is the theme used on this website. It required me to play around in Python and dig into the Jinja documentation. Although I am mostly satisfied with how it is now, I will continue to polish it as my needs for this site evolve.
