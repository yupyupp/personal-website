My name is Stephen Haffner (a.k.a. kd8zev or yupyupp) and this is my personal website. I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering Student at The Ohio State University. I am focusing my degree towards system and network security. I enjoy lower level programming (i.e. my favorite language is C) and I am one of those weirdos that finds assembly kind of fun to play around with. My past classes and work experiences have helped me to develop a solid programming background and my extra-curricular activities have allowed me to gain a deep understanding of Unix based systems and a good grasp of basic networking technologies. I have recently started learning to analyze malware with help of the book *[Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software](https://www.nostarch.com/malware.htm)*. 

## Hobbies
Outside of class I spend a good amount of time experimenting with my personal server network and trying to learn more about 
Although I spend a lot of time at my computer I love being active. I spend a lot of time working on and riding my bicycle to prepare me for my yearly 120 mile trip from Columbus to Cincinnati

I love being outside. At the end of every school year I make a 120 mile bike ride from Columbus to Cincinnati. So I'm not sitting at my computer I'm probably out riding my bike to prepare. My time as a Boy Scout has also taught me to love hiking 


or hiking through the mountains. Cycling, hiking, Occasionally gaming, and messing around in Linux

## What is KD8ZEV?
KD8ZEV is my FCC amateur radio call sign. Since it is unique to me I decided it was a good thing to name my site after; though I do have to admit it is a bit difficult for people to remember.
