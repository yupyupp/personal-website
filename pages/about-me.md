My name is Stephen Haffner (a.k.a. kd8zev or yupyupp) and this is my personal website. I am a third year Computer Science and Engineering Student at The Ohio State University. I am focusing my degree towards system and network security. I enjoy lower level languages (i.e. C) and I am one of those weirdos that finds assembly kind of fun to play around with. In fact, I have recently started learning to analyze disassembled malware with help of the book *[Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software](https://www.nostarch.com/malware.htm)*. My past classes and work experiences have helped me to develop a solid programming background and my own exploration has allowed me to gain a deep understanding of Unix-based systems and a good grasp of basic networking technologies. 

## Hobbies
Outside of class I spend a good amount of time experimenting with my personal server network and trying to learn more about anything related to the field of security. 
Although I spend a lot of time at my computer I love being active. I spend a lot of time working on and riding my bicycle and my time in Boy Scouts has left me with a special appreciation for hiking and backpacking.

## What is KD8ZEV?
KD8ZEV is my FCC amateur radio call sign. Since it is unique to me I decided it was a good domain name; though I do have to admit it is a bit difficult for people to remember.
