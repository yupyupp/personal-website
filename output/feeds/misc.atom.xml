I originally took the site down because I wanted to play around with virtualisation on my server. I ended up playing with OpenStack, XEN, KVM, LXC, and Docker but I finally settled on plain KVM and I now have a KVM host up and running on my Cincinnati server (this site is hosted on a VPS instead of my KVM host for the time being).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this is back up its time to tackle setting up my own mail server!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>New site using Pelican</title><link href="http://haffner.me/new-site-using-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Stephen Haffner</name></author><id>tag:haffner.me,2014-09-10:new-site-using-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After playing around with a few different website generators I have finally settled on &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. Pelican is a static site generator written in python that takes Markdown, reStructuredText, or just plain HTML and parses it into nicely formated posts and pages. It also allows you to choose from a bunch of different themes or you can build one yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to continue to developing my theme (&lt;a href="https://github.com/kd8zev/pelican-theme-zev"&gt;pelican-theme-zev&lt;/a&gt;) so it has an option to display a set page as the home page rather than the most recent posts. But I'll have to dig further into the API of pelican and jinja so thats not a job for tonight :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
